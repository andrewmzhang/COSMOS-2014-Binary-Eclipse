Description
===============
	
	This code, when run, allows one to generate a light curve of a binary star.
	Cicular eclipses are assumed, time is in period phases. Temperature input
	is in kelvins, radius is arbitrary (units can be whatever you want it to be)
	
 	Be sure to choose a valid folder loaction above browse, or the graph will
 	not generate. (Default location is C:\).
